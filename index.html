            <h2> Who Am I?</h2>
            <p> A dreamer. An optimist. A lover of books, food and travel. A student of life. </p>
        
            <h2> Why Web Development?</h2>
            <p> I'd like to become a web developer because I enjoy problem solving and being creative. I like the magic of web development - being able to create and bring something to life. I like the flexibility and opportunity to be challenged and grow. </p>
        
            <h2> My Learning Journey</h2>
            <p> Like many people, the pandemic opened my eyes to what is possible. Learning and work were possible at the comfort of my own home. The world stopped but we continued to work, from home. Technology wasn't going anywhere and I wanted to be a part of that. 
                I started from the bottom. Learnt about the fundamentals of IT, and worked as a technical support representative for a year and now work as a Service Desk Technican. 
                My coding journey started this year when I knew I wanted to combine my love for problem solving and being creative. </p>
